# React useEffect State Mutation Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in React applications involving the incorrect mutation of state variables within the `useEffect` hook. The bug arises from directly incrementing the `count` variable instead of using the `setCount` function provided by the `useState` hook.

## Bug Description

The provided code attempts to increment a state variable (`count`) directly within a `useEffect` hook.  This approach bypasses React's state update mechanism and leads to unexpected behavior and inconsistent UI updates.

## Solution

The solution involves correctly using the `setCount` function to update the state variable. This ensures that React's state management system is properly utilized, resulting in correct and consistent UI updates.
